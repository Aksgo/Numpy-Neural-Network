# Numpy-Neural-Network
<p>The repository contains the code for creating a simple neural network from python and numpy</p>
<br>
<h3>The initial idea  is a NN using numpy :</h3>
<ul>
<li>the project uses a spiral data generated by code</li>
<li>there can be multiple classes so to calculate the loss , we have used categorical cross entropy</li>
</ul>
<b>NOTE : We have further implement MNIST dataset to classify the 28x28 digits using NN build from numpy and maths. Have Fun !!</b>

<p>Below is the progess in the round 1 of training with a simple code and less optimization</p>

<hr>
<p>For next round we added more layers and made the learning rate half each time after 4 epochs : <b> to achieve accuracy of 95.9%</b></p>
